<summary> Is /ghost-equip bannable?</summary>

Simply no. Here is an explanation :arrow\_down\_small:\
\
Cosmetic = Outfits, emotes, pickaxe etc. you equip with /ghost-equip

To avoid downloading 2 MB of data every time you change Cosmetic, the game doesn't check which Cosmetic you are using. This makes it faster to change Cosmetic. \
Another reason why you won't get banned is because the Cosmetic is not visible to you. If the Cosmetic was visible to you, it would be a Skin Changer and using a Skin Changer is bannable, but /ghost-equip is NOT a Skin Changer\
\
The same explanation applies to /fake-level and /fake-crown-wins.
